h1. CallHash

CallHash is a Ruby library that allow what I name "Callable Hashes".

A CallHash is a kind of hash that allows method chaining to get the values
using a bit of method_missing magic. This gives a nice interface for Hashes

h2. Example

Use @CallHash.recurse@ to transform every value which is a Hash to a CallHash

<pre><code>  c = CallHash.recurse :key1 => "value1", :nested => {:key2 => "value2"}
  c.key1 # => "value1"
  c.nested.key2 # => "value2"
</code></pre>
