h1. Metash

Metash is a Ruby library that allow what I call "Meta Hashes".

A Metash is a kind of hash that allows method chaining to get the values
using a bit of method_missing magic. This gives a nice interface for Hashes.

h2. Example

<pre><code>  c = Metash.new :key1 => "value1", :nested => {:key2 => "value2"}
  c.key1                        # => "value1"
  c.nested.key2                 # => "value2"
  c.nested.key2 "Another value"
  c.nested.key2                 # => "Another value"
  c.key3 "value3"               # c.key3 # => "value3"
  c.key4                        # => nil
</code></pre>
